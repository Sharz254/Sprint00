            You could tell that Christopher Robin had something important to sayfrom the way he clasped his knees tightly and wriggled
        his toes. Everybody gathered round and looked at him expectantly.
        “I’ve heard that her Majesty ...” Christopher Robin began.
        “Oh,” squeaked Piglet in a state of great excitement.
        “Her Royal Highness ...” he went on.
        “Quite so, quite so,” agreed Rabbit.<br>
        “The Queen of England ...” he said quickly before anyone else
        could interrupt him.
        “Oh, The Queen,” said Pooh Bear, much relieved. “The other
        people you mentioned sounded much too tall and fearsome, but
        The Queen is quite different.”
        Pooh had once sent a letter and was told to stick on a small
        picture of The Queen. It stuck more to his nose than to the letter
        but it told the postman that it was Most Urgent and that The Queen
        Says It Must Be Sent and so he was sure it had been.<br>
        “As I was saying,” said Christopher Robin, passing Pooh a honey
        sandwich so that he might continue speaking, “Her Majesty The
        Queen is celebrating an important birthday, her ninetieth birthday.
        And we should too. Celebrate it, that is, by giving her a present.”
        “I had a present once,” sighed Eeyore wistfully. “Two in fact, if
        I may boast a little. One was rather small and damp and the
        other somewhat larger and sticky. But I don’t like to complain.<br>
        A present is Something and to have two is Something Else.”
        Both Pooh and Piglet blushed slightly. They had a memory of a
        wonderful balloon and a large jar of the best honey that had begun
        as Exceedingly Good presents and then, due to various mishaps, had
        become Rather Disappointing presents, but which were presents
        nevertheless and as Eeyore had said – that was Something.
        “The question is,” said Rabbit importantly, “what do Queens
        like best?”
        “Honey, I should think,” sighed Pooh, looking at the small, sticky
        crumb where the honey sandwiches had once been.<br>
        “I’ve heard,” said Christopher Robin, who knew a great deal
        about far away places like the other side of the Forest and London,
        “that The Queen has a grand tea every day in her palace, with
        buttered toast and crumpets, so I shouldn’t think we’d need to give
        her anything to eat. Her present should be something to treasure.”
        “I’ve never had much luck finding treasure,” sighed Pooh. “But I
        did once find the North Pole. Do you suppose The Queen might
        like that?”<br>
        The friends thought this an excellent idea but it wasn’t long
        before they realised that finding the North Pole once was a very fine
        thing but that finding it again was an altogether different thing.
        Suddenly the Forest seemed to be full of sticks that could or
        could not be the North Pole.
        “This will never do,” announced Rabbit.quiet and a little time to play.
        And quiet there was. The sort of quiet that makes the tip of your
        nose turn a sunset-shade of pink.
