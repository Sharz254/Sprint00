                What makes a superhero?
            </h2>
            <p>
                A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in away that a normal person couldn't. <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.Otherwise, a polceman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
                For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is going something that a normal human being could'nt do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br>
